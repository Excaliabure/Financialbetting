The exchange rate slipped to a fresh three-month low near $1.0750 as traders rushed to the dollar, following a goldilocks jobs figure that should ease the moods at the Federal Reserve.The dollar has pressed forward across the board, making gains against other rival currencies, including the British pound and the Japanese yen. The cooling economy, some analysts argue, should technically suggest a weaker dollar since the Fed won’t be pressured to hike rates at the same aggressive pace.But forex is a different animal and the dollar is gaining. Down the week, not much crucial data is on deck and traders may use their time to spot another golden unicorn rainbow pattern.

Let’s find out why.The EUR/USD pair dug into a six-month bottom on Thursday, and remains pressured on Friday, after the European Central Bank lifted interest rates to a record high of 4%. As a consequence, the native currency, the euro, changed hands at $1.0630, down from a Thursday opening price of $1.0730.Generally, when the local central bank hikes rates, the local currency shifts gears. But in this case, traders sent a very clear signal that they don’t trust in the ECB’s judgment. The European economy has been faltering and another rate hike only elevated the prospects of an even more painful drag on the old continent’s dealmaking and business activity.Contrary to the euro, Europe’s region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 (SXPP) advanced 1.5% on the day. Individually, France’s CAC 40 added 1.2%, and Germany’s DAX 40 shot up 1%.
