1700985600,"US Dollar Forecast: Growth and Inflation to Extend the USD Sell-off?<ENDOFHEADER>The dollar has been moving lower, in a similar fashion to US yields and US economic data as the world’s largest economy appears to be feeling the effects of tight financial conditions. Labour data has eased since the October NFP report, retail sales and CPI data dropped and overall sentiment data has been revised lower too.In the coming week, High impact US data includes the second estimate of Q3 GDP as well as US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data - the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation.Customize and filter live economic data via our DailyFX economic calendarLearn how to plan and prepare ahead of high impact economic data by claiming our free guide including an actionable news trading strategy:The initial estimate for Q3 GDP (annualized) revealed an impressive 4.9%, however, the second estimate will test the remaining resilience of the economy as general activity data has worsened.One data point closely watched by the Fed is ‘core services excluding housing and energy’, which provides an indication of widespread prices within the services sector where prices have proven to be sticky. The graph below reveals the sideways movement in price pressures which are yet to show a concerted move to the downside. Progress in this measure could contribute towards another leg lower in the dollar as markets look ahead to next year when at least three 25 basis point hikes are priced in.PCE Services Excluding Energy and HousingSource: Federal Reserve, prepared by Richard SnowThe US Treasury is scheduled to auction a decent chunk of US debt next week to fund the US government and its operations. Almost in anticipation, the bond market has propped up yields of the 2-year note in the hopes of acquiring the securities at an attractive yield. While yields have come down from the peak above 5%, levels are still attractive considering it is essentially viewed as a ‘risk free’ asset. Elevated yields may actually see the dollar supported until the major event risk enters the fray from Wednesday.US 2-Year Treasury YieldsSource: TradingView, prepared by Richard SnowThe dollar tested the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) late on Friday after is struggled to build on the bearish momentum after trading below the dynamic level of support previously. A daily close below the 200 SMA could see DXY test 103 flat in the week to come, especially if GDP and inflation data underwhelm. Thereafter, 101.92 comes into view as a level of consideration on the downside. The RSI shows that the bearish move could soon run out of momentum as the indicator approaches oversold territory.Stronger than anticipated data particularly on the inflation front, could revitalise the dollar and see it recover some of the recent losses. Resistance appears all the way up at 104.70 which poses a tall order.US Dollar Basket (DXY) Daily ChartSource: TradingView, prepared by Richard SnowMarkets have also reigned in reactionary expectations of 100 basis points of cuts next year when CPI came out lower than anticipated for the month of October. Currently, markets expect three full interest rate cuts next year with the possibility of a fourth before December 2024.

1701676800,"Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Surge to Fresh 18-Month Highs<ENDOFHEADER>Bitcoin and Ethereum both took a significant leg higher over the weekend, breaking through prior resistance and testing levels last seen in May last year. The cryptocurrency space has been positive for the past few weeks as investors wait for news on the dozen spot Bitcoin ETF applications sitting on the SEC’s desk. A CNBC report last week that SEC representatives met with BlackRock and Grayscale further boosted the bullish market sentiment. BlackRock has filed for both a Bitcoin and an Ethereum spot ETF and their involvement in the space is seen as important. BlackRock has had 575 out of 576 of its ETF applications approved.Bitcoin (BTC) Continues to Rally as Spot ETF Chatter Gets LouderThe technical outlook for Bitcoin has been positive since mid-October when BTC/USD produced a bullish pennant pattern. This coincided with a bullish 50-day/200-day moving average crossover – Golden Cross - and was subsequently followed by a series of higher lows. Prior highs at $38k and $40k have both been broken with ease in the last four sessions. The next level of horizontal resistance comes in just under $43k.Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin this year but has still rallied from around $1,200 to $2,260 since the start of the year. The ETH/USD charts also remains positive with a Golden Cross produced on November 21st and a clear series of higher lows seen since late October. Last Friday’s clean break of resistance at $2,140 opens the way for ETH to rally further with $2,500 and then $3,000 the next logical stopping points.Charts via TradingViewWhat is your view on Bitcoin – bullish or bearish??

The performance of Bitcoin and the Crypto industry in 2023 continues to surprise given the challenges being faced by the industry over the past 18 months.The world’s largest cryptocurrency is approaching $1T in market cap and is up 180% since November 2022. 45% of that growth has been recorded over the past 6 weeks as speculation continues to grow regarding the spot Bitcoin ETF. As things stand, based on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's NAV discount, which has narrowed dramatically, the market assigns a probability of around 90% that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve such a vehicle.The Crypto industry as a whole is benefitting at present having added approximately $750 billion of market cap since November 2022.

A story for another time.Of course, Bitcoin does have its vocal supporters with the likes of ARKS Cathy Wood and MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor. It's worth noting that with all the regulation etc. around Banks, the failure of US Banks this year may have been a blessing in disguise for the Crypto industry.

I had discussed the possibility of this potential pullback last week in my article (to read click here). There does not appear to be any singular driving force behind the move except perhaps the slightly stronger US Dollar. I however think that this is in part down to profit taking ahead of the Risk Events this week and the end of year holidays.Source: TradingViewThe $40 k mark could hold the key heading into the festive break. A break below this level could open up the potential of a deeper retracement down toward the $31k-$32k area. As mentioned above I believe that part of the move is likely down to profit taking as we do have a bunch of risk events ahead. The move down may be welcomed by many, particularly institutions who may want to get involved before the Spot ETF decisions early in 2024. The question is how deep a retracement will we get and will the FOMC meeting play a part?According to CoinGlass data shows that there was an approximate liquidation of around $335 million of long positions over the last 12 hours. The amount of liquidations are represented below with Bitcoin leading the way followed by Ether.Source: CoinGlass/CoinDeskA pullback should not be viewed in a negative light as the overall cloud which many though would hover over the Crypto sector cleared long ago. This is something I have previously discussed but has actually been pointed out in research of late as well. According to research released recently by Coinwire.com, 83% of Crypto mentions in op publications have been positive in 2023. This would explain the resilience of the industry in a time when it has faced a number of challenges.Other key takeaways from the CoinWire study revealed that over 65% of global crypt related Tweets have a positive sentiment. The United Kingdom takes the lead in this global cheer, with more than72%of crypto-related tweets from this region being positive. The US as well is a leader here with approximately 2 out of 3 Americans have a positive view of Crypto in 2023. This is one I admit surprised me given the FTX scandal, but I was once again forced to remember the Banking crisis earlier in the year.I guess the point m trying to make here is a selloff should not be accompanied by doom and gloom and do not get caught up in the FOMO of it all with the festive season ahead. The outlook for 2024 looks promising and I would keep that in mind if we do have a deep and aggressive pullback.Trade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX NewsletterReceive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX teamARK has been consistently selling Coinbase (COIN) shares over the past couple of weeks.

A surprise to me given the positive outlook I have regarding Coinbase in 2024, but that’s a topic for another time.ARK however did the sale due to the target weighting it applies to its ETFs. The recent rally in the Coinbase share price has seen the weight of the shares exceed the limit of 10% imposed by ARK. The sale however failed to accomplish this, as things stand COIN accounts for some 13% of the Fintech Innovation ETF and +-11% of the Next Generation ETF.

While Wall Street’s rate-cut wagers have been extreme, the Fed's forecasts are slowly converging toward the market's outlook – this should be bearish for the greenback and yields moving into 2024.With the broader U.S. dollar in a tailspin, EUR/USD soared towards the 1.0900 handle while GBP/USD jumped past an important ceiling near 1.2600. Meanwhile, USD/JPY nosedived, rapidly falling towards its 200-day simple moving average – the last line of defense against a larger retreat.This article focuses on the technical outlook for major U.S. dollar pairs such as EUR/USD, USD/JPY and GBP/USD, examining key price levels after Wednesday’s outsize moves in the FX space.For a complete overview of the euro’s technical and fundamental outlook, download your complimentary trading forecast now!EUR/USD jumped on Wednesday, clearing technical resistance near 1.0830, corresponding to the 200-day simple moving average.

On further strength, attention would shift towards 1.1015, last month's high.On the other hand, if the upward impetus fades and prices resume their descent, the first support to monitor is located at 1.0830, but further losses could be in store for the pair on a push below this threshold, with the next area of interest at 1.0765.

Bulls will need to staunchly defend this floor; failure to do so could spark a drop towards 141.70 and 140.70 thereafter.Conversely, if USD/JPY resumes its rebound, technical resistance looms at 144.50.

The agreement is for the reduction of global consumption of fossil fuels to avert the worst of climate change, signaling the eventual end of the oil age. This is obviously still some way away with Oil, Gas and Coal still accounting for about 80% of the world's energy, and projections vary widely about when global demand will finally hit its peak.There were concerns regarding the reaction of OPEC+ members and Gulf States and whether they would be supportive of the measures with Saudi Arabia a particular concern. According to a source familiar with the matter, the Saudi position is that it sees “""a menu where every country can follow its own pathway,"" saying it ""shows the various tracks that will allow us to maintain the objective of 1.5 (degrees Celsius) in accordance with the characteristics of every nation and in the context of sustainable development."" There has been this ongoing debate particularly in the developing world around the phasing out of fossil fuels with many countries finding it tough. This is likely to remain the case in Developing countries who will need the most support if anything meaningful is to be achieved.OPEC+ today also doubled down on its own forecasts for 2024 while the US EIA lowered its 2024 Brent despite output cuts. OPEC+ also lifted its estimate of 2023 global economic growth based on its latest monthly report released earlier today.

The Central Bank also signaled an early conclusion to its last remaining bond purchase scheme, all as part of efforts to combat high inflation.For all market-moving economic releases and events, see the DailyFX CalendarThe ECB stated while inflation has dropped in recent months, it is likely to pick up again temporarily in the near term. According to the latest Eurosystem staff projections for the euro area, inflation is expected to decline gradually over the course of next year, before approaching the Governing Council’s 2% target in 2025. Overall, staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4% in 2023, 2.7% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Compared with the September staff projections, this amounts to a downward revision for 2023 and especially for 2024.The confession by the Central Bank regarding a possible uptick in inflation in the near term saw the Central Bank reiterate the need to keep rates at the current level for a sufficient amount of time. The ECB also said it expected that economic growth would remain subdued in the near term with the economy expected to recover because of rising real incomes.On the growth front the ECB projections estimate 0.6% for 2023 to 0.8% for 2024, and to 1.5% for both 2025 and 2026.The ECB Press Conference Begins Shortly.Trade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX NewsletterReceive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team***UPDATES TO FOLLOW****The European Central Bank (ECB) face the toughest task in comparison to the BoE and the Federal Reserve.

Not a lot of pushbacks from the ECB, I did expect more and something in a similar vain to Fed Chair Powell.

According to data provider HCOB, business activity in the Euro Area fell at a steeper rate in December, closing off a fourth quarter which has seen output fall at its fastest rate for 11 years barring only the early-2020 pandemic months.Commenting on the data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, HCOB chief economist said,‘Once again, the figures paint a disheartening picture as the Eurozone economy fails to display any distinct signs of recovery. On the contrary, it has contracted for six straight months. The likelihood of the Eurozone being in a recession since the third quarter remains notably high.’Thursday’s ECB meeting saw the central bank push back against aggressive market pricing of nearly 150 basis points of rate cuts in 2024. President Lagarde said that rates would be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as possible to bring inflation back to target (2%), and that the governing council had not discussed any rate cut timetable. If the Euro Area falls into recession, as looks likely, and inflation continues to fall, the ECB may have to change tack on interest rates and start priming the market for a series of cuts next year. The financial markets are already pricing in the best part of five 25 basis point rate cuts in 2024.The ongoing weakness in the US dollar accelerated late Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell held rates steady for the third month in a row and gave a strong signal that interest rates would be cut in 2024. The Fed indicated that they could cut rates by 75 basis points next year, but this was seen by the market as lowly. After the FOMC press conference had ended, market expectations of US rate cuts for 2024 rose to 150 basis points, with the first 25bp cut seen in March. These expectations, and the selloff in US bond yields, caused the US dollar to fall further.

Key Levels for XAU/USDThe U.S. dollar, as measured by the DXY index, suffered heavy losses last week, pressured by the collapse in U.S. Treasury yields across most tenors following the Federal Reserve’s pivot. Although the U.S. central bank held its policy settings unchanged on Wednesday, it embraced a dovish posture - a turnaround that appeared unlikely based on recent rhetoric.To offer some context, the Fed adopted a more optimistic view of the inflation outlook, acknowledged the start of discussions about rate cuts and signaled 75 basis points of easing in 2024 at the end of its last meeting of the year. The unexpected shift in the strategy caught investors by surprise and on the wrong side of the trade, sending interest rate expectations sharply lower (see chart below).Source: TradingViewNew York Fed President John Williams contested the idea of policymakers openly talking about slashing borrowing costs in an interview before the weekend, but Wall Street downplayed this contradiction. Many theories have emerged to explain the change in tune, but most traders believe it is not a complete policy reversal, but a damage control tactic to tamp down animal spirits and prevent financial conditions from easing further.Wondering about the U.S. dollar’s technical and fundamental outlook? Gain clarity with our quarterly forecast. Download it now!With markets increasingly confident that the Fed will ease its stance materially over the next 12 months, bond yields and the U.S. dollar are likely to stay biased to the downside in the near term. However, interest expectations could change, especially if incoming data indicate strong growth and elevated inflationary pressures. For this reason, traders should keep a close eye on the economic calendar.The first days of the week won’t feature any major risk events, but Friday will hold significance with the release of Personal Income and Outlays, a key report containing information on consumer spending and, more importantly, core PCE, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge.For the FOMC’s path, as discounted by market participants, to remain dovish, personal spending and core PCE must exhibit restraint. A failure to show moderation would signal that the economy is still running hot and that it would be premature to ease the policy stance - a scenario that could spark a hawkish repricing of interest rate expectations, boosting the greenback in the process.The screen capture below, sourced from DailyFX's economic calendar, presents the consensus estimates for the upcoming Personal Income and Outlays report.Source: DailyFX Economic CalendarFor a complete analysis of the euro’s medium-term prospects, request a copy of our quarterly trading outlook.

If bullish momentum continues to diminish and sellers re-enter the scene, the first line of defense against a bearish assault lies at 1.0830, near the 200-day simple moving average. Subsequent losses could bring attention to 1.0770, followed by long-term trendline support at 1.0640.On the other hand, if the pair manages to consolidate higher and takes out overhead resistance stretching from 1.0995 to 1.1020, a potential move towards the 1.1100 handle could be in the cards. Breaching this ceiling may prove challenging for the bulls, but in the event of a breakout, the prospect of revisiting the 2023 highs in the vicinity of 1.1275 cannot be dismissed.EUR/USD Chart Prepared Using TradingViewExplore the dynamics of the Japanese yen in the FX markets by downloading our comprehensive guide on trading USD/JPY – packed with expert tips!USD/JPY plummeted last week, breaching and closing below the 200-day simple moving average, marking a bearish development in technical analysis.

This being the first sign that it may spread and affect the Global Economy, something which had been stressed by Central Bank bosses from the EU, Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. All Central Bank heads cited their concern that the longer the war draws on the greater the likelihood of a spread which could have consequences from Global growth and the Global Economy.

A close back above 33,500 means another test of the 33,900/34,000 zone could be in play.​A close back below 32,750 would be needed to put further bearish pressure on the index.",0.8936195969581604,0.9994696974754333,-0.960540235042572
1703232000,"British Pound Forecast: GBP/USD Pushing Higher Despite Growing Rate Cut Calls<ENDOFHEADER>​Most Read: GBP Breaking News: CPI Miss Aligns UK with Other EconomiesFor all market-moving economic data and events see the DailyFX Economic CalendarThe Bank of England is set to cut interest rates by at least 125 basis points next year with the first quarter-point reduction seen at the May 9th MPC meeting. This dovish re-pricing is in part due to the latest UK inflation report (see story above) that showed the rate of inflation falling sharply. Such has been the recent fall that some banks now see UK inflation at 3% at the end of H1, while a couple of others see it down at the BoE’s target of 2% over the same time frame.UK government bond yields continue to fall with the rate-sensitive 2-year now trading at 4.02%, down from a mid-July spike high of 5.77%, while the 10-year UK benchmark is offered at 3.50% a fresh eight month low.Lower inflation rates will be needed next year to help kick-start the ailing UK economy that is close to falling into recession, according to the latest GDP statistics released by the ONS earlier today. Final Q3 GDP contracted by 0.1% missing expectations, while Q2 GDP data was revised to flat from a prior reading of +0.2%.With a series of UK rate cuts expected next year, Sterling would normally weaken, but this is not the case as a raft of other major economies look to slash their borrowing costs in 2024. The latest CME Fed Fund expectations are currently showing seven US rate cuts next year, although the last one is finely balanced.Cable is benefitting from US weakness and is back above 1.2700 and testing a clutch of prior multi-month highs. A break and open above last Thursday’s 1.2794 high will leave cable eyeing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.2823 before a prior small swing high just under 1.300 comes into focus.Retail trader GBP/USD data show 48.44% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.06 to 1.The number of traders net-long is 8.07% lower than yesterday and 14.93% higher than last week, while the number of traders net short is 6.45% higher than yesterday and 11.61% lower than last week.We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests GBP/USD prices may continue to rise.What Does Changing Retail Sentiment Mean for GBP/USD Price Action?Sterling is on the back foot against the Euro and is currently trying to break through the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages. EUR/GBP remains a range trade with the pair seemingly stuck in a rough 0.8500 – 0.8750 range for the last eight months. Unless either UK or EU rate expectations change markedly, this range should hold going forward.Charts using TradingViewWhat is your view on the British Pound – bullish or bearish??

However, Japanese Yen strength has faded this week as the BoJ meeting and inflation put an end to speculation that a pivot in policy was on the horizon. Earlier on Friday we heard from ECB Policymaker Schnabel who stated than a short-term rise in inflation is expected and that there is still some way to go on inflation.Looking ahead to next week and even with some medium impact data from Japan, the thin liquidity environment is likely to keep any significant moves muted. The ongoing geopolitical tension adds a further layer of intrigue. I am expecting a quiet week with a lot of rangebound trading looking the most likely.

1703577600,"Top Lesson of 2023 - Discipline is Paramount in Rapidly Changing Markets<ENDOFHEADER>Trading in forex or other financial assets necessitates a steadfast commitment to a carefully devised plan and effective risk management. This year, I learned first-hand that straying from a well-established strategy impulsively can lead to detrimental outcomes.My approach to trading has always been systematic and methodical. Before entering any trade, I meticulously outline my investment thesis, analyze crucial price levels, and pre-define both the assumed risk and profit targets. This disciplined approach has generally served me well, fostering a sense of control and rational decision-making. However, a specific case this year underscored the critical consequences of straying from these guidelines.In the pursuit of larger profits, I found myself succumbing to the allure of greed. Believing that momentum was firmly on my side and that nothing could go awry, I took for granted my unrealized gains, keeping my position open for way too long. Then, in the blink of an eye, prices shifted against me, turning a winning trade into a large loss.By moving the goalposts, I deviated from my meticulously crafted trading plan, forgetting for a moment that markets can be unforgiving and unpredictable. In doing so, I violated the very parameters that had previously guided me to success, leaving me grappling with the aftermath of my own imprudent decisions.The key takeaway from my personal experience is crystal clear: do not improvise or stray from the original strategy at a whim and always prioritize sound analysis over impulsive decisions, especially if you are speculating with short-term options, which was my case. My journey served as a vivid reminder that emotions like greed have the potential to obscure judgment and result in adverse outcomes.Moving forward, I am committed to reinforcing the importance of discipline in my trading approach. I recognize that the allure of reaping greater profits should never compromise the foundation of a well-constructed plan. The cost incurred by deviating from the plan served as a tough yet essential lesson, instilling in me a revitalized commitment to adhere to my processes.",0.0,0.0,0.0
